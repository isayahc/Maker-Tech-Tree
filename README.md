# Maker's Tech Tree

A project that uses llms and OpenAI's shap-e to generate assests, as well as how these assests could be used in experiments.

# Goal

Leveraging a LLM, vectorstore and text-to-3d model to generate science experiments and physical tools

# Current Tools
- Shap-e for text-to-3d
- GCP for storage of 3d assests
- Weaivaite for vectorstore
- OpenAi LLMs for LLM
- HuggingFace for hosting MVP

## Objects
- `Apparatuses` Apparatuses are made up off Components
- `Experiments` Experiments are Generated by a LLM
